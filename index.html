        <h3>About Jin </h3>

        <p>
          I was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea. In August 2015, I moved to Iowa to study Business Analytics at the University of Iowa. I came back to Korea after my sophomore year to serve military duty.
          In Fall 2021 semester, I resumed my schooling. During my academic career, I have earned various technical skills to become a business/data analyst.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an international student, I have particularly contributed to advancing diversity and inclusion within the college.
          Serving as a global ambassador, I have led the Tippie Buddies group where domestic and international students can network with others from various backgrounds.
          Furthermore, I applied to Global Engagement Student Advisory Board (GESAB) because I was aware of the challenges that international students encounter inside and outside of the school.
          Collaborating with faculties and other student organizations, we coordinated the international business student surveys to scrutinize what hinders their engagement and to design possible initiatives that support their involvement in the college. 
          In addition to those roles, I help prospective and admitted international students as an International Student Ambassador. I have assisted the University Admission Department by providing resources to those students who have concerns about finance, college life, etc.
